Inspired by omailson's dotvim (https://github.com/omailson/dotvim), I decided
to make my own, with my preferences

== Dependencies ==

Some that I can remember now:

python27
git
ruby


== Steps to use ==

Run in the root project dir:

$ ./configure.py

This will:

    * Create a minimal vimrc file, that will source the real vim configuration file -> dotvimrc.vim
      You can edit the dotvimrc.vim file to reflect your preferences.
    * Create a plugins dir and clone all the plugins repositories in pluginsrepos file
    * Create a .backup and .tmp dir, for backup and temporary files, respectively

Then run make

$ make

This will compile the command-t plugin and generate your plugins help tags.

The install it with:

$ make install

This will create a symbolic link at ~/.vimrc, pointing to vimrc file, created by configure

Have Fun!
